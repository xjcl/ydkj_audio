A lot of audio programs, such as *Audacity*, support encoding files as AIFF ([Audio Interchange File Format][1], developed by *Apple Inc.*).

However, I need specifically an AIFF file that has been *compressed with ima4*, making it an AIFC file.

The internet seems to be nearly clueless about AIFC and ima4. "convert to AIFC" (with quotes) yields exactly 0 results on Google (3M for MP3, 90K for WAV, 45K for FLAC, ...).

Possible solutions:

 - **ffmppg**. I know `ffmpeg -i wavefile.wav -f aiff wavefile.aiff` converts to AIFF but I can't figure out how to specify the compression algorithm.
 - **afconvert**. According to [here][2], we can use `afconvert -f AIFC -d ima4 [file]`. But this is a Mac-only program and I only have access to Windows and Linux Mint machines.
 - **afftools**. [See here][3]. This strangely seems to be a Fedora-only program, and I once again can't find anything on it on Google (if it even does what I want).
 - **Adobe Audition**. [See here][4]. Once again I do not own this paid-for software.
